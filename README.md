# CORE VERTICAL — Scientific Research

This repository defines the Scientific Research vertical for CORE.

It is a **reproducibility-first scientific operations system** that supports:
- experiment lifecycle
- replication and peer review
- artifact integrity
- publication-ready packaging
- cross-lab comparability

This vertical is built for real lab workflow needs.

## Physics Stack (Authoritative)

Scientific Research composes:

- ALL CORE engines (as selected per project)
- SIGNAL for universal analysis outputs
- RGSR for controlled multi-domain fusion and coupling studies

## Curated Real-World Phenomena

This vertical is curated to support scientific investigation across domains, including:

- resonance and coupling discovery
- fluid/thermal/EM/material interactions
- structural resonance and vibration research
- subsurface and geophysical analysis
- sensor fusion experiments and reproducibility tests

It is not limited to one phenomenon class; it is curated for the scientific method.

## What This Vertical Is

- A **scientific operating layer** on top of CORE engines
- A **replication and verification platform**
- A **publication artifact packaging system**
- A **peer review workflow environment**

## What This Vertical Is NOT

- Not a casual visualization dashboard
- Not an ungoverned sandbox
- Not an “AI conclusions generator”

## Registries & Lenses (Maintained Here)

- Experiment protocol registry (versioned)
- Reproducibility profile presets (tolerances, determinism requirements)
- Peer review workflow definitions
- Publication packaging templates
- Artifact quality gates (what qualifies as publishable)

## Required Research Workflow Features

This vertical standardizes:
- run sealing and locking
- version pinning (engine release identity)
- artifact completeness checks
- replication workflow support (same inputs + same engine = comparable outputs)
- review metadata and change history

## Governance

This vertical inherits CORE governance.
Nothing in this repo can weaken auditability, access boundaries, or engine registry law.
